        <strong>Messy, boring—on purpose, abstract art.</strong><br>
        Every NFT funds bold, Queer-led projects and creative action.<br>
        This is not about perfection. It’s not polished.<br>
        It’s about people. It's about community.<br>
        It’s powerful.<br>
        Own a piece of the mess.<br>
        Help change the world.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why these NFTs matter</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      These NFTs are more than just digital pieces — they are seeds of support, celebration, and shared love.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The first funds raised will offer a month of paid rest to Mathieu, who created a space of art, culture, and connection — a place where love can travel, meet, and be celebrated in peace, joy, harmony, or with a sparkle of playful madness.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The next step is to support the launch of a unique and brave project led by my dear friend Æris — a true visionary of community care. Their work builds a safe, inclusive, and open space for free, conscious, and loving intimacy between adults who meet in respect, safety, and mutual joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the journey unfolds, these tokens will help fund more events and creations rooted in the same spirit — spreading across Europe and, why not, around the world.
