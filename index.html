    <h1>Messy, boring—on purpose, abstract art.</h1>
    <p>Every NFT funds bold, Queer-led projects and creative action.<br>
    This is not about perfection. It’s not polished.<br>
    It’s about people. It's about community.<br>
    It’s powerful.<br>
    Own a piece of the mess.<br>
    Help change the world.</p>

    <div class="exhibition-title">“Eau, d'Or, d'Art, Gens”</div>
    <div class="exhibition-description">
      Water, gold, art, people—four elements, one chaotic symphony.<br>
      This artwork explores the fluidity of creation and the way these essential concepts interact within the messy, unpredictable world of art.<br>
      Each canvas represents an essential aspect of our collective experience: <strong>"Eau"</strong> (Water) as the lifeblood of all things, <strong>"d'Or"</strong> (Gold) symbolizing value and wealth, <strong>"d'Art"</strong> (Art) as the medium through which we express our deepest truths, and <strong>"Gens"</strong> (People) as the heartbeat of every movement.<br>
      The chaotic backgrounds remind us that beauty often emerges from disorder, and that true art is alive and untamed.

    <h2>Why these NFTs matter</h2>
    <p>These NFTs are more than just digital pieces — they are seeds of support, celebration, and shared love.</p>

    <h2>💥 My Art Professors Would Probably Want to Kidnap Me 💥</h2>
    <p>My art professors would want to kidnap me, lock me up, tie me down, and torture me with the most creative, sadistic techniques the world has ever known — for eternity.<br>
    (And honestly? Why not — as long as I give my full, free, and informed consent at every step of the process, of course. I’m messy, not unethical.)</p>
    
    <p>My parents? They’d probably disown me. They spent years shaping me into an artist... and this is how I repay them? With abstract disasters and glorious mess? You're welcome.</p>

    <p>If I’d been in Iran? No man would ever want to marry me — Thank the Universe. (Just kidding! …Or am I actually onto something?)</p>
    <p>If I’d been in Iran? I’d probably be killed for blasphemy for some parts of this imagery.</p>

    <h2>💸 The Scent of Money...</h2>
    <p>It all started the day I dropped in to say hi to Mathieu. He told me he’d just been hospitalized — short stay — burnout. My heart cracked.</p>

    <p>While we talked, I reached behind his counter, pulled out a glass full of International fiat money, and started smelling each bill, one by one.</p>

    <p>He looked at me like I was completely unhinged and asked, “What are you doing?”<br>
    “I’m smelling them,” I replied.</p>

    <p>He told me, “L'argent n'a pas d'odeur.” (French way of saying “Money doesn’t smell.”)<br>
    Oh, darling. But it does.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>❤️‍🔥 This Isn’t Just About Me. It’s Bigger.</h2>
    <p>Mathieu isn’t the only radiant, beautiful human in my life who’s stretched too thin. So I created this fund — with my RedT NFTs — to raise real support for my people, for our people, our TRIBE.</p>

    <p>Through this fund, we’ll support the wider community. We’ll build safe, wild, celebratory spaces — across Europe and beyond — where love can be seen, touched, danced and celebrated with in every form, shape, sound, size, color, frequency, and vibration.</p>

    <p>The first funds raised will offer a month of paid rest to Mathieu, who created a space of art, culture, and connection — a place where love can travel, meet, and be celebrated in peace, joy, harmony, or with a sparkle of playful madness.</p>

    <p>The next step is to support the launch of a unique and brave project led by my dear friend Æris — a true visionary of community care. Their work builds a safe, inclusive, and open space for conscious, intentional and loving intimacy between adults who meet in respect, safety, and mutual joy.</p>

    <p>As the journey unfolds, these tokens will help fund more events and creations rooted in the same spirit — spreading across Europe and, why not, around the world.</p>
