        <strong>Messy, boring—on purpose, abstract art.</strong><br>
        Every NFT funds bold, Queer-led projects and creative action.<br>
        This is not about perfection. It’s not polished.<br>
        It’s about people. It's about community.<br>
        It’s powerful.<br>
        Own a piece of the mess.<br>
        Help change the world.

  <!-- Why These NFTs Matter Section -->
  <div class="mt-16 max-w-2xl mx-auto px-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why these NFTs matter</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      These NFTs are more than just digital pieces — they are seeds of support, celebration, and shared love.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">💥 My Art Professors Would Probably Want to Kidnap Me 💥</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
      My art professors would want to <span class="highlight">kidnap me</span>, <span class="highlight">lock me up</span>, tie me down, and torture me with the <span class="highlight">most creative, sadistic techniques</span> the world has ever known — <em>for eternity</em>.<br />
      (And honestly? Why not — <strong>as long as I give my full, free, and informed consent at every step of the process</strong>, of course. I’m messy, not unethical.)
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      My parents? They’d probably disown me.<br />
      If I’d been in Iran? No man would ever want to marry me — <strong>Thank the Universe.</strong> (Just kidding! …Or am I actually onto something?)
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I’d probably be killed for <span class="highlight">blasphemy</span> for this type of imagery.<br />
      And that’s how this whole beautiful chaos began.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">💸 The Scent of Money...</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      It all started the day I dropped in to say hi to <strong>Mathieu</strong>. He told me he’d just been hospitalized — short stay — <span class="highlight">burnout</span>. My heart cracked.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      While we talked, I reached behind his counter, pulled out a glass full of <strong>International fiat money</strong>, and started <strong>smelling each bill</strong>, one by one.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      He looked at me like I was completely unhinged and asked, “What are you doing?”<br />
      “I’m smelling them,” I replied.<br />
      He told me, <em>“L'argent n'a pas d'odeur.” (French way of saying “Money doesn’t smell.”)</em><br />
      Oh, darling. But it <strong>does</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">❤️‍🔥 This Isn’t Just About Me. It’s Bigger.</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Mathieu isn’t the only radiant, beautiful human in my life who’s stretched too thin. So I created this fund — with my <strong>RedT NFTs</strong> — to raise <span class="highlight">real support</span> for my people, for our people, our TRIBE.
    </p>
   
    <p class="mb-4">
      Through this fund, we’ll support the wider community. We’ll build <span class="highlight">safe, wild, celebratory spaces</span> — across Europe and beyond — where <strong>love</strong> can be seen, touched, and danced and celebrated with in every form, shape, sound, size, color, frequency, and vibration.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The first funds raised will offer a month of paid rest to Mathieu, who created a space of art, culture, and connection — a place where love can travel, meet, and be celebrated in peace, joy, harmony, or with a sparkle of playful madness.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The next step is to support the launch of a unique and brave project led by my dear friend Æris — a true visionary of community care. Their work builds a safe, inclusive, and open space for conscious, intentionnal and loving intimacy between adults who meet in respect, safety, and mutual joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the journey unfolds, these tokens will help fund more events and creations rooted in the same spirit — spreading across Europe and, why not, around the world.
